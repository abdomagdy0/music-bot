Example: '/play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'

 
`/play search`:
With this command, you can enter the name of a song and the bot will use the ytdl-core streaming library to find it on YouTube.

`/play playlist`:
 This command works similarly to `/play search`  but is specifically for playlists.
